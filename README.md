This is  a public repo for the Module 10 Challenge of the UW Fintech Bootcamp in 2022.
Assuming the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. The challenge aims at helping you propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. It does so by combining Python skills and unsupervised learning skills to create Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. The notebook plots the results so that they can visually show the performance to the board.
